## Introduction
This project focuses on the calculation of rise and slope in beams, a crucial topic in strength of materials. Using C++, the program analyzes various types of beams and calculates their deflection and slope based on the applied loads.

## Features
- Calculation of rise and slope in various beam types.
- Integrated analysis of moments of inertia.
- Fast and efficient algorithm with simple user input.
- Outputs graphical representation of the results.

## Inputs
- Beam length
- Load position and magnitude
- Beam type (e.g., cantilever, simply supported, etc.)
- Moment of inertia

## Installation
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Beam-Rise-Slope-Calculation
   ```
2. Compile the code:
   
g++ project.cpp -o beam_calculation
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
./beam_calculation
   ```



## How to Run the Project

## Results
After running the code, the program will prompt you to enter information such as the type of beam, the magnitude and location of the applied force and moment, and the length of the beam. Once the inputs are provided, the program will calculate and display the slope and deflection.
