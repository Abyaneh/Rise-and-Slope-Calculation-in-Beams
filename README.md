## Introduction
This project focuses on the calculation of rise and slope in beams, a crucial topic in strength of materials. Using C++, the program analyzes various types of beams and calculates their deflection and slope based on the applied loads.

## Features
- Calculation of rise and slope in various beam types.
- Integrated analysis of moments of inertia.
- Fast and efficient algorithm with simple user input.
- Outputs graphical representation of the results.

## Inputs
- Beam length
- Load position and magnitude
- Beam type (e.g., cantilever, simply supported, etc.)
- Moment of inertia

## Installation
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Beam-Rise-Slope-Calculation
   ```
2. Compile the code:
   
g++ project.cpp -o beam_calculation
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
./beam_calculation
   ```
