# Rise-and-Slope-Calculation-in-Beams
 Implemented a C++ program to calculate the rise and slope in various types of beams, based on beam theory principles. This project involved analyzing different loading conditions and beam configurations, allowing for precise structural analysis. The solution was designed to help engineers understand how forces and moments impact beam behavior.
